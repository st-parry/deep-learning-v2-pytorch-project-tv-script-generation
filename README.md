RNN project as part of the Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree

## Introduction
A project using Recurrent Neural Networks to generate new Seinfeld Scripts based on scripts from 9 seasons.


## Getting the project files
The project files can be found in the Udacity Deep Learning [public GitHub repo](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch/tree/master/), in the <code>project-face-generation folder</code>.

You can download the files from there, but it's better to clone the repository to your computer. This way you can stay up to date with any changes we make by pulling the changes to your local repository with <code>git pull</code>.
